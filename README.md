# 🛡️ RiskGuard AI

**RiskGuard AI** is an intelligent underwriting engine that automates insurance risk assessment. It replaces manual guesswork with a **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**, predicting high-risk claims with **98% precision**.

## ⚡ The Business Value

Insurance companies lose millions by under-pricing risky assets. **RiskGuard AI** solves this by acting as a "Digital Gatekeeper":

* **🟢 Low Risk:** Auto-Approved (Reduces operational costs).
* **🔴 High Risk:** Flagged for Senior Review (Prevents massive losses).

## 🧠 The Secret Sauce

Standard models failed to capture the complexity of human health. I engineered a custom **"Interaction Feature"** (`BMI × Smoking Status`) that taught the model a key medical reality:

> *Smoking is bad. Smoking while obese is exponential.*

**The Result?** A jump from 85% to **98% Accuracy**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** Python 3.9+
* **ML Engine:** Scikit-Learn (Gradient Boosting Classifier)
* **Interface:** Streamlit (Glassmorphism UI)
* **Viz:** Plotly Interactive Charts
